## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Florian, a PhD student specializing in forestry remote sensing ðŸŒ²ðŸ›°. My work revolves around enhancing forest management planning through advanced remote sensing techniques.

### ðŸ”­ Current Work
- Researching forest structures using remote sensing data from various platforms, primarily airplanes and drones.
- Focusing on LiDAR data and image-based methods to develop cross-technological approaches.
- Methodologically, applying automated and reproducible procedures from the fields of machine learning and deep learning.

### ðŸŒ± Learning and Interests
- Deeply interested in climatology and the impacts of climate change on forest ecosystems.
- Passionate about open-source projects, especially in the context of remote sensing and spatial analysis.

### ðŸ‘¯ Collaboration and Contributions
- Eager to collaborate on projects that involve remote sensing, forestry, or climate change research.
